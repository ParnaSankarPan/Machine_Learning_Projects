# Context

Jamboree has successfully guided thousands of students toward their dream of studying abroad at prestigious institutions. Through innovative teaching methods tailored to GMAT, GRE, and SAT, Jamboree ensures high scores with minimum effort.

Recently, Jamboree introduced a new feature on their website that predicts students' probability of getting into Ivy League colleges, based on their academic and extracurricular profiles, with a focus on graduate admissions from India. This tool empowers users to explore their chances in a data-driven manner.

# Objective

- Identify key factors influencing graduate admissions to Ivy League colleges.
- Understand the interrelation of these factors and their impact on admission probabilities.
- Develop a predictive model to estimate a studentâ€™s chances of admission based on these variables.

# Work Done in the Project

## Data Collection

- Gather historical admissions data of Indian students applying to Ivy League institutions (including GPA, GRE/GMAT scores, TOEFL/IELTS scores, work experience, research contributions, extracurricular achievements, etc.).
- Collect user-provided data through Jamboree's platform.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze trends and correlations between variables to identify key predictors of admission chances.
- Address any missing or inconsistent data using techniques such as KNN imputation or statistical methods.

## Feature Engineering

- Create meaningful features representing factors like academic performance, standardized test scores, research impact, and leadership roles.
- Encode categorical data (e.g., field of study, extracurricular involvement) for model use.

## Model Selection & Development

- Experiment with machine learning models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost for classification.
- Choose the model with the highest predictive accuracy (e.g., based on F1 score or AUC-ROC).
- Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness of predictions.

# Insights Generation

- Share insights about the relative importance of predictors to help users tailor their application strategy.
- Highlight which factors (e.g., GPA, research experience, GRE/GMAT scores, extracurriculars) most strongly influence admission chances.
- Provide actionable advice based on model findings, such as:
  - If research contributions significantly boost chances, encourage students to pursue internships, publish papers, or undertake research projects.
  - If standardized test scores are highly influential, advise on strategies to maximize GRE/GMAT performance.
  - If leadership roles and extracurriculars matter, suggest ways to strengthen profiles through volunteering, clubs, or projects.
- Regularly update insights as new data is collected to keep recommendations relevant and data-driven.
